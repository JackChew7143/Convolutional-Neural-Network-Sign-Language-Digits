Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tend to perform better than normal neural networks, especially on image-related tasks. Here are some reasons why CNNs often achieve higher accuracy for image classification:

Local Connectivity:

CNNs leverage the concept of local connectivity, where each neuron is connected to a small, localized region of the input image. This allows the network to focus on local patterns and spatial hierarchies, which are crucial in images.
Hierarchical Feature Learning:

CNNs learn hierarchical features in a layer-wise manner. The initial layers capture low-level features like edges and textures, while deeper layers combine these features to recognize more complex patterns and objects. This hierarchical feature learning is beneficial for image recognition.
Reduced Dimensionality:

Pooling layers in CNNs reduce the spatial dimensions of the input, preserving important features while discarding unnecessary details. This reduction in dimensionality helps in focusing on essential information and accelerates computation.



Convolutional Layers (Conv2D):

The first three layers are Conv2D layers with ReLU activation functions. They apply convolutional operations to the input image with 3x3 filters, aiming to capture spatial hierarchies and detect patterns in the image.
Each Conv2D layer is followed by a MaxPooling2D layer, which reduces spatial dimensions and retains important features.
Fully Connected Layers:

After the convolutional layers, the model includes Flatten layer to convert the 2D feature maps into a vector.
Dense layers follow, performing classification based on the features extracted by the convolutional layers. The use of BatchNormalization helps stabilize and accelerate training.
Dropout:

Dropout layers are introduced to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero during training.
Output Layer:

The output layer has 10 neurons (classes for CIFAR-10) with softmax activation for multiclass classification.
Compilation:

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, and categorical crossentropy is chosen as the loss function for multi-class classification.
Training:

The model is trained using model.fit() on the training data (X_train, Y_train) for 10 epochs, with validation data provided for monitoring performance on unseen data.
Evaluation:

The trained model is evaluated on the test data (X_test, Y_test) using model.evaluate(), and the test accuracy is printed.
In summary, this code defines and trains a CNN for image classification. Convolutional layers are employed to extract hierarchical features, and fully connected layers perform classification. Dropout and batch normalization are used for regularization, and the model is trained using the Adam optimizer. The performance is then evaluated on a separate test dataset.
